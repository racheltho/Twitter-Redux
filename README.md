# Twitter-App

Note: This project is a continuation of [my previous Twitter-App](https://github.com/racheltho/Twitter-App).  I used [this tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/78568/create-slide-out-navigation-panel-swift) for help getting started.

Required features:
- Hamburger menu that is revealed by dragging.  Menu includes links to profile, home timeline, mentions, tweet composer, and to logout
- Profile page contains the user header view and basic user stats
- Tapping on a user image from the home timeline or from the mentions timeline brings up that user's profile page.
